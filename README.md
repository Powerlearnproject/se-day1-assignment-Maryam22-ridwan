Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principle,methods and tools to the development and maintance of high-quality software systems. it plays a very important role in the
tech industry by enabling the creation of software applications and system that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 ANSWER: I.development of programming language e.g fortran
II. the advent of structured programming
III. the rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANSWER: I. requirement: it involves gathering and documenting users need.
ii. design: creating high-level and detailed design of software architecture.
iii. implementation: writing code and building software according to design specification.
iv. testing: conducting various test to see if the software meet quality standard.
v. deployment: realeasing software to users.
vi maintanace: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANSWER: COMPARISM: They are both software development methodologies
CONTRAST: Water fall uses sequencial approach while agile uses iterative and incremental approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ANSWER: i. software developer: responsible for writing codes.
ii. quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plan.
iii. project manager: oversees the planing, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANSWER: IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g visual studio
VCS: use for tracking changes to source code e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHALLENGES: Changing requirement, tight schedule and technical debt.
SOLUTIONS:Effective communication, use of agile methodologies,priotizing task.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT: testing individual component of softwarre
INTERGRATION: testing interaction between various component.
SYSTEM: testing the entire software as a whole
ACCEPTANCE: testing the software against user requirement.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering



Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is a way of crafting questions or statement to get the best output from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vagues prompt: difference between dog and cat
clear: give the biological and evolutionary difference between dog and cat.
